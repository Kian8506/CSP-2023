    <h1 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Second project was minion stacker.Once you start the code, The timer starts as well. Minions slowly but surely fall from the sky. Once you see a minion then you are able to move them by using the A and D ( left and right). Once you are able to move the minions you can start placing them on each other. Keep in mind that the timer is short so you have to have the skills to be able to score high.</h1>
